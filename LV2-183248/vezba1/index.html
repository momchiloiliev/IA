        <p>Windows 10 is currently available as Technical Preview which means that there are still a lot of issues and bugs
            which need fixing before the Operating System gets ready for use by consumers. Some users using the Windows 10 Technical
            Preview (build 9926) are facing an odd issue where the Start Menu (and Cortana/Search) would not work/open anymore,
            no matter if they click on the Start Button, Press the Windows key on the keyboard or press Ctrl + Esc. System Restore seems to
            be the cause of this error, but there can be more. Anyways, here’s how to sort it out.</p>

        <p>On Windows Phone, you can pin just about anything you want to your Start screen—apps, albums, map locations, favorite websites,
            OneNote notes, contacts, and a lot more. When you pin a contact to Start, you'll get all of that person's feed updates
            right from their Tile, and you can call them with just two taps. Tons of other apps and websites also come with Live Tile support,
            so you don't even have to open an app to see notifications or other real time info.</p>
